I am a computer science student in my third year of study. My passion lies in solving problems and embracing new challenges. However, don't let my love for all things tech fool you! I also have a creative side that I enjoy expressing through reading, painting, and designing. So, let's just say I am a tech-savvy artist with a passion for problem-solving... and maybe a touch of quirkiness thrown in for good measure. ✨💻🎨🖌️<br />
<br />
I plan to upload and share as many of my projects and ideas as possible!


<!--I'm a computer science student in my 3rd year and my passion lies in solving problems and taking on new challenges. But don't let my love for all things tech fool you, I'm also a creative soul at heart. When I'm not coding away, you can find me lost in a good book or creating masterpieces on canvas. So, let's just say I'm a tech-savvy artist with a passion for problem-solving... and a little bit of quirkiness thrown in for good measure.
