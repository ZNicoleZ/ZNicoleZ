I am a computer science student in my third year of study. My passion lies in solving problems and embracing new challenges. However, don't let my love for all things tech fool you! I also have a creative side that I enjoy expressing through reading, painting, and designing. ✨💻🎨🖌️<br />
<br />
I plan to upload and share as many of my projects and ideas as possible!
